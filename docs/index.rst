Welcome to QDynamics's documentation!
=====================================

QDynamics is a header-only library for the integration of rotational dynamical systems based on quaternionic dynamics, as described in the paper (Fraser & Schonrich 2021).

We provide here a basic Quaternion class as well as a generalised integrator framework, contained within the QDynamics namespace. This work is heavily inhereted from some of my earlier work, in particular `JSL::Vector() <https://jackstandardlibrary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vectors.html>`_. The relevant libraries are contained within a git-submodule, so you should (hopefully) have everything you need within the basic git repo provided.
