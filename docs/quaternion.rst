We define both a basic quaternion datatype, and several functions which take quaternion arguments to aid us in the development of a quaternion integrator. 

Many of the basic quaternion operations, such as addition and scalar multiplication are inhereted from the `JSL::Vector() <https://jackstandardlibrary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vectors.html>`_ class.
